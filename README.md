# The Veiled History of Artifacts and Their Keepers

This resource accompanies the digital history project, The Veiled History of Art and Artifacts and Their Keepers, which examines art repatriation and restitution from US fine art institutions. The project content, presented on the Scalar platform, can be accessed by clicking on the following link: http://visarchive.com/scalar/the-veiled-history-of-artifacts-and-their-keepers/index.  

This repository includes two main datasets, organized as two spreadsheets, titled, “Institution” and “Art Repatriation and Restitution”. 

The contents of the project folder are accessible through Scalar for viewing and download in a PDF format. Certain file types are not supported by Scalar. This repository serves as an external source that circumvents the limitations of the platform. Those who are interested in analyzing or building upon the framework of my dataset will find these files in .xlsx and .cyjs formats useful. 

Networks rendered in Cytoscape, an open-source network software are included as well for download as .sif and .cyjs files. Static representations of networks were rendered through Cytoscape and uploaded to the site as jpeg images.
